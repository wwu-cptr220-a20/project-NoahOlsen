<h1>Is there such thing as a credible source today?</h1>

            Topic Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            In todays day and age, it seems like more and more conflicts arising in political matters end up boiling down to a, "your word against mine" type of argument.
            <a href=https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart>Biased news companies<a/> like Fox news and CNN both claim to have the most credible sources, which in turn usually results in extremely divided political views.
            The recent <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHnqaDZ2KLk&ab_channel=SkyNews>presidential debate<a/> is a good example of this with Donald Trump and Joe Biden often interupting each other to deny the claims they make. 
            With both political parties claiming they have the "correct" ideologies and sources, a means to validate which party is correct, though it would be a tough task, 
            would be a step in the right direction to solving alot of problems in america.
