<h2 class="history"> What is Esports?</h2>
<body>
    <p class="whatis"> 
        Esports is named after a derivation of the term, "Electronic Sports."
        These "Esports" are competitive video games that enter a sports style 
        competitive environment with prize pools, fans, casting, sponsorships, and several 
        other characteristics of your common competitive sports like the NFL, NBA, or MLB.
        These organizations have recently made efforts to make collaberations with the top players
        and teams from Esports due to its growth in popularity.
    </p>
    <h2 class="dev">Development</h2>
    <p>
        Although Esports is one of the most popular, and still growing, forms of sports; 
        it didnt always have the same attention it has today. It's growth in popularity started 
        very small, and has seen most of its growth in the last 10-15 years.
    </p>>
    <p class="dev">
        The earliest known "Organized Esports Event" was held at Stanford University in 1972 
        for the game called <em>"Spacewar"</em>. The prize for winning this event was a year long 
        subscription to the Rolling Stones Magazine. Definitely a very coveted prize.
    </P>
    <p id="70-90">
        Throughout the rest of the 70's and 80's, small events were held, mainly in colleges, 
        for new games being released. It wasnt until the 90's came around for events to start being
        sponsored by companies like "Blockbuster" and "Nintendo." Some of the most profound players in 
        Esports today started their careers playing in these tournaments as kids. 
    </p>
    <p id="2000">
        In the early 2000's many new styles of games like first person shooter games (FPS) hit the market
        and started to shape the industry for the coming years. Game franchises such as  <em>"Halo"</em>
        and many others were the pioneers of the Esports industry as FPS style games would go on to
        be the highest grossing category of games in Esports. 
    </p>
    <p id="2010">
        The 2010's is where the biggest popularity boom in the industry happens. With the rise of streaming services
        and content platforms such as <Em>"Twitch"</Em> and <em>"Youtube"</em>, the audience 
        for Esports was vastly expanded, which in turn led to more and more people both watching, and competing.
        These platforms are very crucial in Esports broadcasting and you can learn more about their 
        relation and impacts <a href=""> here</a>. These years started to see large prize pools for games
        due to a much larger audience. In 2011, the first Leage of Legends World Championship was hosted
        in Sweden with a prize pool of $100,000. Tournaments like these would continue to show larger and 
        larger prize pools as the games gained popularity.
    </p>
    <p id="BR">
        Battle Royale style games would change the industry into what it is today. Taking on a, 
        "Hunger Games" style shooter environment, many players were dropped into a map and had to loot up and
        eliminate other players until them or their team were the last ones standing. The typical size of just one of these
        games was 50-100 players which lead to very competitivee games. Fortnite is one of these games and
        is arugable one of the most, if not the most, popular game in the last few years. Released in 2017, Fortnite 
        quickly grew in popularity due to game being a free triple A standard game. This grabbed the attention
        of many twitch streamers and youtube creators, which in turn brought more people to the game.
        Since it was free, there wasn't a reason to not play it. Almost everyone knows what fortnite is today because of this.
        In the summer of 2019, Fortnite hosted the "Fortnite World Cup" which is the first Esports tournament 
        Ever to be open to the entire public, not just organized teams. Anyone in the world could compete 
        to qualify for an official $13,000,000 prize pool. With Fortnite gaining so much traction around the world,
        many big name news companies started making content about it. Tyler "Ninja" Blevins, was the firts
        pro gamer to be on the cover of ESPN Magazine, having started his career in the early 2000's with "Halo."
